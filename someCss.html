                Portgas D. Ace born as Gol D. Ace and nicknamed "Fire Fist" Ace,
                was the sworn older brother of Luffy and Sabo, and the biological son
                of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, and Portgas D. Rouge. Ace was adopted
                by Monkey D. Garp, as had been requested by Roger before his execution.
                Ace was the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates and one-time
                captain of the Spade Pirates.

                Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the 
                leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come
                to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom
                Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent 
                figures consider this to be exaggerated.
